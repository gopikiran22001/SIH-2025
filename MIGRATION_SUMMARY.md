## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Zoom Video SDK Integration
- Mock SDK implementation for development
- Session management (create, join, leave)
- Audio/video controls (mute/unmute)
- User role management (host/attendee)

### 2. Video Consultation Service
- Creates unique session IDs for each consultation
- Manages consultation lifecycle (pending → active → completed)
- Integrates with existing Supabase database
- Maintains compatibility with existing appointment system

### 3. User Interface
- Full-screen video call interface
- Call controls (audio, video, end call)
- Prescription creation for doctors
- Connection status indicators
- Participant information display

### 4. Database Compatibility
- Uses existing `video_consultations` table
- Maintains all existing consultation history
- Compatible with current authentication system
- Preserves patient-doctor relationships

## Authentication & Session Management
- Uses existing Firebase Auth for user login
- Generates unique Zoom session IDs per consultation
- Secure token/session handling through Supabase
- Role-based access (doctor as host, patient as attendee)

## UI/UX Features
- "Start Consultation" / "Join Consultation" buttons
- Live video feed placeholder (to be replaced with actual Zoom widget)
- Call controls: end call, mute/unmute, camera on/off
- Call status display (connecting, ongoing, ended)
- Prescription creation dialog for doctors

## Event Handling
- Session join/leave callbacks
- User join/leave notifications
- Connection state management
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Development Status
- ✅ Architecture implemented
- ✅ Mock SDK created for testing
- ✅ UI components completed
- ✅ Database integration working
- ✅ Service layer implemented
- ⏳ Awaiting actual Zoom Video SDK Flutter package
- ⏳ Production credentials needed

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Obtain Zoom Video SDK License**
   - Create account at marketplace.zoom.us
   - Get App Key and App Secret

2. **Integrate Real SDK**
   - Find/create Flutter package for Zoom Video SDK
   - Replace mock implementation
   - Update video view widget

3. **Testing**
   - Test on physical devices
   - Verify camera/microphone permissions
   - Test network scenarios

4. **Deployment**
   - Update credentials
   - Configure production environment
   - Monitor performance

## Benefits of New Architecture
- **Scalability**: Zoom's infrastructure handles video processing
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade video quality and stability
- **Security**: Built-in encryption and security features
- **Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant video communications
- **Features**: Advanced video features and controls
- **Maintenance**: Reduced complexity compared to WebRTC implementation

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing consultation history preserved
- Database schema unchanged
- User authentication system intact
- Appointment booking flow maintained
- Doctor-patient relationships preserved
